# Architecture decisions

Why Jerry's target architecture ([`overview.md`](./overview.md), [`crates.md`](./crates.md)) looks
the way it does — the reasoning and rejected alternatives, not just the rule. `CLAUDE.md` and the
`architecture` skill state each rule in a line or two and point here for the argument behind it,
deliberately, so they stay short.

This is a **decisions log, not a running narrative** — the distinction that matters after this
project's own `BUILD-LOG.md` (592 KB, a growing chronicle nobody could tell was current) got
deleted for exactly that reason (§4 below). A decision here is written once. If a later decision
changes an earlier one, it gets its **own new numbered entry** below, and the old entry's Status
line is updated to point at it — never edited back to "current." Add a new entry only for a real
decision (a new crate boundary, a new cross-cutting rule, a reversal) — not for every routine
application of one that already exists here.

## 1. Core crates stay free of `gpui`

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** `wt-core`, `pty-core`, and `lsp-core` were already built with no `gpui` dependency —
verified: the only two occurrences of the string `gpui` in those three crates are comments, one
about a version pin, the other noting that a real GPUI fake-clock test isn't possible without one.
This wasn't written down anywhere, so it was one dependency addition away from silently breaking.

**Decision:** No crate other than `crates/app` (and the planned `crates/jerry-cli`, which must
never gain one either) may depend on `gpui` or `gpui_platform`. This is the foundation the rest of
the target architecture is built on: it's what makes a headless CLI over the same domain logic
possible at all.

**Consequences:** A PR adding `gpui` to `wt-core`/`pty-core`/`lsp-core`'s `Cargo.toml` is a hard
reject, not a design discussion. Any type crossing from a core crate into `crates/app` and back
must be plain data — never a `gpui::Context`, `Window`, or similar (`crates/app/src/work_surface/agents.rs`
violates this today by taking `Context<AdeApp>` directly in agent-lifecycle methods; tracked as
follow-up, not retroactively blessed). `lsp-core`'s one cross-crate dependency (`pty-core`, for
`resolve_on_path`) staying a path dependency between two gpui-free crates is fine and doesn't need
repeating elsewhere.

## 2. Commands and queries, not loose functions, as the application-layer unit

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** `wt-core` exposes its capabilities as loose, well-named functions —
`commit_all_changes`, `attempt_merge`, `discard_worktree`, `resolve_hunk`, and about forty more.
Clean, but no shared shape: each has its own argument list and result type, so nothing can dispatch
them generically. That matters because the same action needs to be triggerable from the GPUI view
*and* from a future `crates/jerry-cli`, and actions need to compose (a merge that discards on
conflict, a commit that also pushes) without one caller knowing the other's calling convention.

Two shapes were considered. **Plain hexagonal — application services**: group the existing
functions into service structs behind port traits. Standard, but a service method is still just a
function with extra ceremony — it doesn't give the CLI and the view a common thing to dispatch, or
composition a unit to compose. **Command + Query, reifying every action as a value**: each
mutation becomes a `Command` with a typed input struct and typed outcome; each read becomes a
`Query`. One dispatch function serves any caller that can construct the input.

**Decision:** Adopt Command + Query.

```rust
pub trait Command {
    type Outcome;
    fn validate(&self, ctx: &Ctx) -> Result<(), ValidationError>;
    fn execute(self, ctx: &Ctx) -> Result<Self::Outcome, Error>;
}
```

`wt-core`'s existing functions map onto this almost one-to-one — `commit_all_changes` becomes
`CommitAllChanges { paths: Vec<PathBuf> } -> CommitAllChangesOutcome`, and so on. The
transformation is mechanical: the logic inside each function doesn't change, only its calling
convention does.

**Consequences:** `crates/jerry-cli` becomes possible without duplicating logic — it constructs the
same `Command` values the view does and calls the same `execute`. New capabilities are added as new
`Command`/`Query` types starting now, even though the existing `wt-core` functions aren't
retrofitted in this pass. This is deliberately *not* a command bus with an execution log — undo/redo
and provenance tracking already exist as their own hand-built mechanisms (`wt-core::undo`,
`crates/app/src/provenance/`); layering a generic event-sourced bus on top would duplicate them for
no immediate benefit. A real need for a unified execution log would be its own new entry here, not
an assumption baked into this one.

## 3. The view dispatches commands and queries; it never calls an adapter directly

**Status:** Accepted. Partially enforced — see Consequences.

**Context:** `crates/app`'s render layer currently calls straight into `wt-core` and, in one place,
straight into a raw process spawn: `graph_view/render.rs` alone has 109 `wt_core::` references,
`sidebar/render.rs` has 33, and `sidebar/render.rs:6534` shells out to
`std::process::Command::new("git")` directly, bypassing `wt-core` entirely. Several `render.rs`
files also call `cx.background_spawn`/`cx.spawn` directly around adapter calls, duplicating the
offload-to-background decision ad hoc at every call site.

This works today because `crates/app` is the only consumer of `wt-core`. It becomes a real problem
the moment a second consumer (`crates/jerry-cli`) exists: behavior implemented as "whatever the
render function happens to do around the `wt_core::` call" isn't available to the CLI, and a bug
fixed in the view's copy has to be separately remembered in the CLI's.

**Decision:** Render code (`render.rs`, anything returning `impl IntoElement` or implementing
`Render`) may only read state already held on `AdeApp` and dispatch a `Command`/`Query`, rendering
the outcome. It may never call `wt_core::`, `pty_core::`, `lsp_core::`, or `std::process::Command`
directly. The background-spawn decision moves into the dispatch layer, once, instead of being
repeated at every call site.

**Consequences:** This is currently violated at scale (204 direct adapter references across
`render.rs` files, per `.claude/conventions-baseline.json`) and is **not** retroactively fixed by
this decision — it's the target; the gap is tracked as GitHub issues. New render code must not add
new adapter calls, effective immediately, and this is now **mechanically checked**, not just
reviewed against: `.claude/hooks/check-conventions.sh` greps every `render.rs` file for
`wt_core::`/`pty_core::`/`lsp_core::`/`process::Command::new` and fails — in the pre-commit hook and
in CI — if the count exceeds the checked-in baseline. It's a textual ratchet (the count may only go
down), not a type-aware lint, and it needs no prerequisite. A full `clippy::disallowed-methods`
version, scoped to `render.rs` files, is still blocked on cleaning up `use super::*` globs first:
today a glob means a lint can't reliably tell which module a symbol resolved from — that cleanup is
tracked as its own issue, and the ratchet is the interim mechanical backstop until it lands.

## 4. `BUILD-LOG.md`/`ASSESSMENT.md` retired in favor of this decisions log

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** `BUILD-LOG.md` (592 KB, 7,715 lines) was a hand-written, append-only narrative
changelog of early build sessions. `ASSESSMENT.md` (24.7 KB) was a one-time, end-of-build
retrospective. Both were treated as living documentation — `CONTRIBUTING.md` told every new
contributor to read both before starting and mandated updating `BUILD-LOG.md` "alongside real
functional changes." Neither was current: `BUILD-LOG.md`'s last commit predated 241 of the
repository's 587 commits (~41% of project history undocumented in the file CONTRIBUTING called the
design record), and `ASSESSMENT.md` had exactly one commit — its own creation — and said so about
itself, opening by calling itself a stale snapshot left as-is rather than rewritten. Both files'
style — long narrative prose, revision numbers (R1–R12, R8.5a), design-history justification inline
with the artifact it documents — is also the pattern `CLAUDE.md`'s comment rule now excludes from
source comments; keeping the files around as the "proper place" for that material would have
undermined that rule immediately.

**Decision:** Delete both files. Git history retains every word for anyone who wants the
archaeology. Their replacement is this decisions log: entries written once, not maintained as a
running log, explicitly not a substitute for `git log`.

**Consequences:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s instructions to read and update `BUILD-LOG.md` are removed.
`README.md`'s `## Status` states current status directly rather than deferring to `ASSESSMENT.md`.
Design decisions worth recording going forward get a new numbered entry above, not an appended
paragraph in a long-running file.

## 5. `gix` for reads; the `git` CLI where git's own output format is the product

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** `wt-core` has both `gix` and `std::process::Command` available to it, and the choice
was being re-argued per function, inline, in module comments. The two are not interchangeable.
`gix` is a library over the object database and refs; it has no formatter that reproduces
`git diff`'s unified-diff text (hunk headers, rename and binary detection, and working-tree state
blended in), and `gix-diff` works on tree and blob objects rather than the working tree.

**Decision:** Reads that ask the object database or the ref store a structured question — resolving
`HEAD`, finding a reference, computing a merge-base, walking commits — go through `gix`. Anything
whose *product* is git's own text or whose semantics live in the porcelain — the unified diff,
`ls-files`, `stash`, `worktree remove`, index manipulation — shells out to the `git` CLI, with an
explicit argument vector (never an interpolated string) and with any config it depends on pinned
via `-c`.

**Consequences:** Reimplementing `git diff`'s output format on `gix-diff` primitives is out of
scope, and a PR proposing it needs to argue with this entry first. Shelling out means the invocation
owns its own correctness: pin the config the parser assumes (`diff.mnemonicPrefix`,
`diff.noprefix`, `core.quotePath`), validate any object id reaching an argument vector as hex, and
treat stderr on a successful command as noise rather than failure.

## 6. One place answers "what does this worktree contain"

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** Two features hand-rolled worktree enumeration independently and both tripped on the
same directory: a recursive `fs::read_dir` walk behind the search panel, and an unconditional
`git add -A` behind review snapshots. A gitignored build directory dominates a real checkout — this
repository's own `target/` is the large majority of its files — and a filesystem walk must open and
`stat` all of it before discovering there was nothing to search, because ignore matching happens
after descent. Git's happens before it.

**Decision:** `wt-core::worktree_files` is the single answer, built on `git ls-files --cached
--others --exclude-standard`. New callers use it rather than growing a third walk.

**Consequences:** "Content" means what git would show: tracked paths stay listed even under a
later-added ignore rule, and untracked paths appear only if git would offer to stage them. A caller
that must keep working outside a git repository owns its own fallback, since this returns an error
there rather than an empty list.

## 7. Interactive rebase is driven through git's own editor hooks, not reimplemented

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** Jerry needs `git rebase --interactive`'s six todo verbs without an interactive
terminal. The alternative to driving real git is reimplementing the todo machinery on plumbing
(`cherry-pick`, `commit --amend`, `reset`) — which means re-deriving conflict handling, `squash`
message combination, `REBASE_HEAD`/`stopped-sha` bookkeeping, and resume-after-restart semantics
from scratch.

**Decision:** Drive the real `git rebase -i` non-interactively through the same environment hooks
a human's `$EDITOR` is invoked through. `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` is set to a `cp` of a
Jerry-written todo file, replacing git's generated one. `GIT_EDITOR` is a `/bin/sh` script that
classifies each invocation *by the content of the message file git hands it*, never by invocation
order:

1. First line `# This is a combination of ...` → a `squash` combination; accept unmodified.
2. Contains `You are currently editing a commit` → a `reword`; pop the next slot from a persisted
   message queue. Nothing queued means exit non-zero, which reproduces `edit`'s stop exactly.
3. Anything else → a conflict-resumed step; accept git's pre-filled message and **do not** advance
   the queue cursor.

Case 3 is not optional. A conflict-resumed `pick` goes through git's ordinary `commit` codepath and
does open the editor; treating that as a `reword` consumes a message meant for a later row.

**Consequences:** Sidecar state (todo file, editor script, message queue, cursor, and a plan
cross-reference) lives under `<git-dir>/ade-rebase/`, resolved per-worktree rather than in the
shared common dir, and survives until the rebase completes or aborts — so a stop can be
reconstructed after a process restart, including whether a row was `edit` or a message-less
`reword`, which git alone cannot distinguish once stopped. The queue is plain files, not JSON, so
the `sh` script needs no parser. Env var values are spliced unquoted into a shell command line by
git, so every embedded path must be POSIX-single-quoted. The editor script is `/bin/sh`, making
this path Unix-only; elsewhere it surfaces as an ordinary spawn failure. Conflicts are never
auto-resolved or rolled back, matching `crate::rewrite`.

## 8. `pty-core` owns spawning only; `alacritty_terminal` stays in `crates/app`

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** Upstream Zed drives `alacritty_terminal::tty::Pty` directly and lets its `EventLoop`
own a thread that both pumps bytes and feeds the `Term` grid parser — one composition, not
separable into a standalone spawn primitive.

**Decision:** `pty-core` owns spawn, raw-byte output, resize and kill via `portable-pty`, and knows
nothing about ANSI escapes or grid state. `crates/app` owns the `Term` grid, driven by the bytes
this crate streams.

**Consequences, all load-bearing:**

- **The output channel is bounded.** An undrained unbounded channel is an unbounded leak —
  measured at ~40MB/s of RSS growth against a `yes` pipe. A full `sync_channel` blocks the reader's
  `send`, so it stops calling `read`, the kernel pty buffer fills, and the child's `write` blocks:
  ordinary terminal backpressure.
- **Shutdown is a self-pipe, not a dropped master fd.** `try_clone_reader()` hands back an
  independently `dup`'d fd, so dropping `master` does not unblock the reader. An earlier version
  only appeared to work because `take_writer()`'s `Drop` writes `\n` + EOT, which local echo bounced
  back and incidentally woke the read — with `stty -echo`, the thread leaked for the process's life.
- **Kill signals the process group *and* a `/proc` descendant walk.** `portable-pty` calls `setsid`,
  so `killpg` reaches ordinary descendants, but anything calling `setsid` itself escapes it. The
  descendant set is snapshotted *before* signalling, because reading it afterwards races the kernel
  reparenting a dying process's children.
- **`Drop` never blocks; `shutdown()` is the deterministic one.** `Drop` signals and does one
  non-blocking `try_wait`, handing any unreaped child to a detached thread — a multi-hundred-ms
  freeze here would freeze the GPUI thread. `shutdown()` blocks until the tree is dead and reaped.
- **Input goes through a writer thread.** A full pty write buffer would otherwise block whichever
  thread called `write_input`, plausibly a key handler on the main thread.

**Windows is narrower, and untested on real hardware** (reasoned from `portable-pty` 0.9.0 and
`filedescriptor` 0.8.3 sources plus `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`). `kill()`
terminates the direct child only — job objects are the only alternative and need `unsafe` FFI, so
grandchildren can survive as orphans. There is no self-pipe either: `WSAPoll` accepts only sockets
and a ConPTY master is a named pipe, so the reader blocks until `master` itself drops, *not* when
the child is reaped. Callers must therefore poll `try_wait` rather than wait for the output channel
to disconnect. These paths are `#[cfg(windows)]`, never `#[cfg(not(unix))]`, so an unsupported
non-unix target fails to compile instead of silently inheriting Windows semantics.
